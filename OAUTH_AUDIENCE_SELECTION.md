# 🎯 OAuth Consent Screen - Audience Selection

## ✅ Select: **EXTERNAL**

### Why Choose External?

**Select "External"** because:

1. ✅ **BlessedBump is a public app** - Any expecting parent should be able to use it
2. ✅ **Not limited to your organization** - Users don't need to be part of your company/organization
3. ✅ **Real-world usage** - External is for public-facing apps (which BlessedBump is)
4. ✅ **Can add test users** - You can add test users during development
5. ✅ **Production ready** - Once ready, you can publish to production

## ❌ Don't Select: Internal

**"Internal" is for:**
- Apps only used within your company/organization
- Google Workspace organizations
- Private/internal tools
- Not for public-facing apps like BlessedBump

## 📋 What Happens When You Select External

1. ✅ Your app starts in **"Testing" mode**
2. ✅ Only **test users** you add can use Google login initially
3. ✅ Once ready, you can **publish to production**
4. ✅ Then **anyone** with a Google account can log in

```
