   - Make sure you're signed in with your Google account

2. **Select Your Project**
   - Look at the top of the page
   - You'll see a dropdown that says "Select a project" or shows your project name
   - Make sure "BlessedBump" (or your project name) is selected

3. **Open the Menu (if needed)**
   - Look for the **☰ (three horizontal lines)** icon in the top-left corner
   - Click it to open the navigation menu (if it's not already open)

4. **Navigate to APIs & Services**
   - In the left sidebar menu, look for **"APIs & Services"**
   - Click on it
   - A submenu will appear

5. **Click on "Library"**
   - Under "APIs & Services", click on **"Library"**
   - This will take you to the API Library page

### Step 2: Search for Google+ API

Once you're on the Library page:

1. **Find the Search Box**
   - At the top of the page, you'll see a search box
   - It might say "Search for APIs & Services" or just have a magnifying glass icon

2. **Type in the Search Box**
   - Click on the search box
   - Type: `Google+ API`
   - OR type: `Google Identity Services API` (newer version)

3. **Look for Results**
   - You should see search results appear below
   - Look for either:
     - **"Google+ API"** (older, but still works)
     - **"Google Identity Services API"** (newer version)
   - Either one will work!

---

### Step 3: Click on the API

1. **Click on the API Name**
   - Click on either:
     - **"Google+ API"** (if it appears)
     - OR **"Google Identity Services API"** (preferred, newer)
   - This will open the API details page

---

### Step 4: Enable the API

1. **Find the Enable Button**
   - On the API details page, you'll see a big blue button
   - It will say **"Enable"** or **"ENABLE"**

2. **Click Enable**
   - Click the blue **"Enable"** button
   - Google will start enabling the API

3. **Wait for Confirmation**
   - You'll see a loading spinner or progress message
   - Wait a few seconds (usually 5-10 seconds)
   - Once enabled, you'll see:
     - A checkmark ✅
     - Message like "API enabled" or "Google+ API has been enabled"
     - The button might change to "Manage" or "Disable"

## 🎯 Visual Navigation Path

```
Google Cloud Console
│
├── Top Bar
│   ├── ☰ Menu Icon (top-left)
│   └── Project Dropdown (top, make sure your project is selected)
│
└── Left Sidebar Menu
    └── APIs & Services
        ├── Dashboard
        ├── Library  ← CLICK HERE
        ├── Credentials
        └── OAuth consent screen
```

Then on the Library page:
```

│
├── Search Box (top)  ← Type "Google+ API" here
│
└── Search Results
    └── Google+ API  ← CLICK HERE
        └── Enable Button  ← CLICK HERE
```

---

## ✅ Success Indicators

You'll know it's enabled when you see:

1. **On the API page:**
   - ✅ Checkmark icon
   - Green text saying "API enabled"
   - Button changed from "Enable" to "Manage"

2. **You can verify:**
   - Go back to: **APIs & Services** → **Dashboard**
   - You should see "Google+ API" listed under "Enabled APIs"

## 🔍 Alternative: Which API to Use?

**Google+ API** (Older)
- Still works perfectly
- Simpler name
- Recommended if you see it first

**Google Identity Services API** (Newer)
- More modern
- Google's preferred option
- Recommended for new projects

**Either one works!** Pick whichever appears in your search results.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "I can't find the menu"
- Look for **☰** (three horizontal lines) icon in the top-left
- Click it to open/close the sidebar menu

### "I don't see 'APIs & Services'"
- Make sure you're signed in
- Make sure a project is selected (top dropdown)
- The menu might be collapsed - click the ☰ icon

### "Search box doesn't show results"
- Try typing: `Google+ API` (with the + sign)
- OR try: `Google Identity`
- OR try: `Identity Services`
- Make sure you're on the "Library" page (not Dashboard)

### "Enable button is grayed out or missing"
- Make sure you have the right permissions
- Make sure a project is selected
- Try refreshing the page

### "API is already enabled"
- That's fine! It means it's already set up
- You can skip this step and move to the next one (OAuth Consent Screen)
